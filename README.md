Shape-to-qiime
==============

Python scripts to deal with fastQ files from non-model sequencing designs (e.g. different amplicons or amplification strategies), so they can fit in the Qiime pipeline.

Our PCR design consists of a two-step dual-indexing PCR protocol (similar to Nextera), which drastically reduces the costs of ordering multiple indexed primers. The following scripts are being used to demultiplex the samples, separate the amplicons, trimm the adaptors and etc...
